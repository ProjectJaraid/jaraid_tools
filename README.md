# oXygen project file

The oXygen project file provides a number of XSLT transformation scenarios to transform our XML TEI data into a static HTML site based on the ZMO's layout. This is legacy code last touched in 2014!

1. *Jaraid ZMO delivered*: This makes use of `xslt/zmo-website/HTML v4e6 ZMO.xsl`
2. *Jaraid current development*: This makes use of `xslt/zmo-website/HTML v4e12 ZMO.xsl`
